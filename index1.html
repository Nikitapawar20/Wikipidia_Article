        <h1> HTML</h1>
        <h2><b> 1.Introduction</b></h2>
        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) </a> and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
            <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank"> Web browsers</a>  receive HTML documents from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank">web server</a> or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance
           <br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="_blank">HTML elements </a>are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
          <code> <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="nt">img</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> and
            <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="nt">input</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> </code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and
            <code> <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> and
            <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="nt">/p</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span></code> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
       <br>
       HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank"> JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the 
       <code><span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="nt">canvas</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span></code>element, together with JavaScript.

               <p> HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS
                Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
            </p>
             <p>
                    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML

          <b>5.Markup </b>
          </h2>
          <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like , although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag they are also called opening tags and closing t Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
          
          <div><pre><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
            <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

            <p>The text between <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>describes the web page, and the text between <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> is the visible page content.

                The Document Type Declaration <span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering</p>

            <h2><b>6.Semantic HTML</b></h2>
            <p>
                Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,but has also included presentational markup, such as <span class="p">&lt;<span class="nt">font</span><span class="p">&gt;, <span class="p">&lt; <span class="nt">i</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> and <span class="p">&lt;<span class="nt">center</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> tags. There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content and presentation.
            </p>
            <p>In a 2001 discussion of the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Semantic_HTML" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a>, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users.Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close[citation needed]. The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="_blank"> web developers </a> web developers, who already know the web locations and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="_blank">API semantics</a> of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.</p>
            <p>An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the web crawler or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine" target="_blank"> search-engine </a> spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with search facilities without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.</p>
            <p>In order for search engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of the published text</p>
            <p>Good semantic HTML also improves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility" target="_blank">accessibility </a> of web documents (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines" target="_blank"> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>). For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.</p>
            <p>Presentational markup tags are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation" target="_blank"> deprecated</a>in current HTML and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML" target="_blank">XHTML</a> recommendations. The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer accessibility, higher cost of site maintenance, and larger document sizes.</p>
          <br> 
          <hr>
          <h2><b>7.Delivery</b></h2>
         <p>HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" target="_blank">HTTP</a> from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank">web server</a> or by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email" target="_blank"> email.</a></p>
         <h3>i.HTTP</h3>
         <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">World Wide Web</a> is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank"> Web browsers</a>  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meta_data" target="_blank"> meta data</a> usually includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encodings in HTML).</p>
         <p>In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be well-formed XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.</p>
         <p>The W3C recommendations state that XHTML 1.0 documents that follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation's Appendix C may be labeled with either MIME Type. XHTML 1.1 also states that XHTML 1.1 documents should be labeled with either MIME type.</p>
         <h3>ii.HTML e-mail</h3>
         <p>Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting and semantic markup not available with plain text. This may include typographic information like colored headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams. Many such clients include both a GUI editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them. Use of HTML in e-mail is criticized by some because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise phishing attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse spam filters and because the message size is larger than plain text.</p>
         <h3>iii.HTML Application</h3>
         <p>An HTML Application (HTA; file extension .hta) is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.</p>
